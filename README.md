Multi-Command / Multi-Functioned Robot car

This project implements a multifunction robot car using Arduino UNO, capable of obstacle avoidance, Bluetooth control, and voice control. 
The project involves integrating various components and sensors to create a versatile robot capable of performing different tasks.

## Features

- Obstacle Avoidance: The robot is equipped with sensors to detect obstacles in its path and autonomously navigate around them.
- Bluetooth Control: Control the robot using a Bluetooth-enabled device, such as a smartphone or tablet. This allows for remote control and maneuvering.
- Voice Control: The robot responds to voice commands, adding an interactive and hands-free control option.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO
- Chassis and frame components
- L293D Motor Driver/Stepper/Servo Shield for Arduino
- DC motors and wheels
- Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance
- Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05)
